# Battleboat Online
A multiplayer battleship implementation, implemented with a modern material design and a decentralized peer-peer matchup engine. Has a built-in AI to play against, but players are auto-matched with other human players by default. 

## Implementation Details
The project is powered by a Firebase database backend with custom permissions, allowing games to be created and observed by any player, but not altered.

## Awesome! Where do I play?
This project is currently hosted by Firebase [here](https://battleboat-online.firebaseapp.com). If you don't find a human player to play against, remember that there's always the man-vs-machine challenge!
